# darwish-rainmeter

## Welcome to my repository for [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) where I had made graph widgets for CPU usage and RAM
## It does have a clock widget before but the previous font is missing. No time to change it yet.
## The latest widget is a shortcut for my university [UMP](https://www.ump.edu.my/en/ump) which are KALAM and Ecommunity

### make sure it was cloned into the right folder
### Make sure [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) is already installed. You can download it [here](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
### Do give me a feedback. I really need your feedback

### Feel free to fork this repository
